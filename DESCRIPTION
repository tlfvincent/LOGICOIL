Description: This package contains the functions necessary to run the LOGICOIL algorithm. LOGICOIL can be used to differentiate between antiparallel dimers, parallel dimers, trimers and higher-order coiled-coil sequence. By covering >90 percent of the known coiled-coil structures, LOGICOIL is a net improvement compared with other existing methods, which achieve a predictive coverage of around 31 percent of this population. As such, LOGICOIL is particularly useful for researchers looking to characterize novel coiled-coil sequences or studying coiled-coil containing protein assemblies. It may also be used to assist in the structural characterization of synthetic coiled-coil sequences.
